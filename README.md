# UI5 WebComponents Example

SAP released a open source version of their [UI5-like web component library](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/index.html). 

This is a "minimal" example of a very basic, vanilla JS "ToDo List" using the UI5 WebComponents as UI Elements. 
It features no storage, no backend, nothing fancy. It requires webpack to be build because its an easy tool to get things 
like this running. 

The intent for this is to be a simple show case of what these components and be used to do and how one would use them. 

In a real world scenario there would be a real framework like react involved in order to help with event handling and 
separating things. 

### how to get going?
```
$ git clone <this thing here>
$ npm install
$ npm run dev-server
$ $BROWSER http://localhost:8080
```
